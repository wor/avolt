TODOS
===========

Program functionality
---------------------

- If large volume while frontpanel (headphones) on then switching to speakers
  still can produce volume spike. Fix it! Also sleeping after rising volume to
  org level might help. Check!
- Save current volume and restore it if front panel toggling fails.
- Now only master volume is set.

Code cleanup
------------

- Add licence headers for all files, add LICENSE file.
- Add documenetation, add README file.
- Consider adding a man file.
- Check const correctness.
- Refactor: remove avolt.conf include from avolt.conf.c, include avolt.conf only
  in main program file and only once.
- Fix unused variable warnings
